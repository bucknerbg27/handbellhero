### Quick Overview
Grab 4 to 8 people, the [KidsPlay Handbell Set](http://www.grothmusic.com/p-41-kidsplay-8-note-diatonic-handbell-set.aspx), and ring yourself silly with a bunch of Christmas tunes.

### Background
For the background of this project, and helpful information, check out [this blog entry](http://panurgynet.blogspot.com/2014/12/handbell-hero.html).

### Before you run the game
This probably works best on a Windows system (yeah, I know....)
You'll need to do the following:

   * Clone/download this repo to your PC.
   * Make sure you have the Java 8 SDK installed, and in your PATH. You can verify this by running this from a command-line: `javac -version`,  it should display something like `javac 1.8.x`
   * To compile/build the game, run the command `hh.bat compile`  If the build fails, double check that your `PATH` is pointing to **Java 8**.
   * For the optimum visual effect, go into the `resources` directory, right click on the file `Nightmare Hero.ttf` and select the option to **Install**.
   * From the command line, change directory to the directory that contains this repo, and run `hh.bat`
   
### For best results
This game has been optimized for a 720p display/projector.  It doesn't scale well (I didn't bother going that far overboard with the coding).

### Other limitations
This game currently works best with the MIDI files that are provided. Visit the blog post for more information about how to use your own song files.

### Huge thanks to these people and resources

   * [Allen Fisher](https://twitter.com/allen_fisher), for doing a superb job putting together the MIDI files
   * [Marshall Baltzell](https://twitter.com/Marshall__Arts), for doing an amazing job with the two image files, especially on the Handbell Hero logo - he was dead-on with the appearance.
   * [Matt Bresnan](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/matt-bresnan/1/969/169), for coming up with the initial game design, and giving me the opportunity to take some time to code up the game.
   * The creator of the [Nightmare Hero font](http://www.dafont.com/nightmare-hero.font), which adds to the visual effect of the game.
   * The [audio effect](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/The+Recordist+Free+Sound+FX/3955075) on the selection menu, which adds to the audible effect of the game.
   * Apache [FilenameUtils](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/FilenameUtils.html) - they have libraries that make coding easier (and less cumbersome).
   
### Copyright/License

   * Help install/run this at a school, and give kids the gift of music and teamwork (without charging them for your "services").
